# SwiftOtter Magento (v1) Log Viewer

The purpose of this module is to track log entries (system.log, exception.log and others) that are made between page views
and present them in a helpful manner. This is to replace using `tail -f var/log/system.log` and to provide greater exposure
to the warnings and logs that our code is generating.
